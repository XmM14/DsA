WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

In general an algorithm is a few well-defined instructions to solve a problem. In computer programming, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions which takes a set of inputs and produces the expected output.
An algorithm to add two numbers:
Take two number inputs
Add numbers using the + operator
Display the result

Qualities of good algorithm :

Input and output should be detailed aright.
Each step must be transparent for others.
Algorithms should be most effective among other solution to this problem.
An algorithm should be written in a way that it can be used in different programming languages, not for any specific programming language.
