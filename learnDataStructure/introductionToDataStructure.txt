What are Data Structures?
------------------------------------------
Data structure is a storage lika a shelf where we store data in an organized way so that it can be manipulated efficiently. We choose different data structures depending on our projects requirement.

Types of Data Structure :

1) Linear data structure
2) Non-linear data structure
	Graph
	Tree

Linear data structures
-----------------------------------
In linear data structures, the elements are stored in a particular order.

Popular linear data structures are :

Array
Stack
Queue
Linked list

Non-linear data structures
------------------------------------------
In non-linear data structures, the elements are not stored in a particular order.Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where each element can be connected with other. They are further partitioned into graph based data structure and tree based data structure.

Popular Graph based data structures are :

Spanning Tree and Minimum Spanning Tree
Strongly Connected Components
Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List

Popular tree based data structures are :
Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
B+ Tree
B-Tree
Red-Black Tree
AVL Tree

Why we use Data Structure?
---------------------------------------------
We implement data structure so that we can access and update our data more easily. Think, if we arrange our book in a book self with a good structure then it would be so efficient for us to get the desired book when we want it. Beside, Data structure helps us to write memory and time efficient code.
